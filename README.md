Udacity Nanodegree Project 1 Investigate a Dataset


PROJECT SPECIFICATION
Investigate a Dataset

Code Functionality

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
Does the code work?

All code is functional and produces no errors when run. The code given is sufficient to reproduce the results described.

Does the project use NumPy and Pandas appropriately?

The project uses NumPy arrays and Pandas Series and DataFrames where appropriate rather than Python lists and dictionaries. Where possible, vectorized operations and built-in functions are used instead of loops.

Does the project use good coding practices?

The code makes use of at least 1 function to avoid repetitive code. The code contains good variable names that have meaning. Comments and docstrings are used as needed to document code functionality making it easy to read.

Quality of Analysis

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
Is a question clearly posed?

The project clearly states one or more questions, then addresses those questions in the rest of the analysis.

Data Wrangling Phase

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
Is the data cleaning well documented?

The project documents any changes that were made to clean the data, such as merging multiple files, handling missing values, etc.

Exploration Phase

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
Is the data explored in many ways?

The project investigates the stated question(s) from multiple angles. At least three variables are investigated using both single-variable (1d) and multiple-variable (2d) explorations.

Are there a variety of relevant visualizations and statistical summaries?

The project's visualizations are varied and show multiple comparisons and trends. Relevant statistics are computed throughout the analysis when an inference is made about the data.
At least two kinds of plots should be created as part of the explorations.

Conclusions Phase

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
Has the student correctly communicated the tentativeness of findings?

The results of the analysis are presented such that any limitations are clear. The analysis does not state or imply that one change causes another based solely on a correlation.

Communication

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
Is the flow of the analysis easy to follow?

The reasoning is provided for each analysis decision, plot, and statistical summary.

Only for Project Reviewers (No student work needed)

Code Review

This rubric is ungraded. The reviewer will provide the student a code review.

Key Takeaways

This rubric will be ungraded. The reviewer will brief the students about the concepts learned in this section of the Nanodegree program.

Question for the Reviewer

This rubric is ungraded. If the learner has asked a question pertaining to the implementation of the project, the reviewer will provide an answer along with links to any helpful resources.****
